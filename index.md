### Yukai SHI(施煜锴)
I am currently a lecturer at Guangdong University of Technology(GDUT). Before that, I received my Ph.D degree in computer science from [HCP Laboratory](http://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/), Sun Yat-sen University, advised by [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/). My research interests include computer vision and machine learning.

During my postgraduate study, I am fortunately to have a visiting experience at [the University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and [Dr. Jingdong Wang](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/), respectively.
